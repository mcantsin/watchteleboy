============

is a script to watch and record live TV streams from 
http://www.teleboy.ch without browser nor flash.

The service was reverse-engineered  by:
Alexander Tuchaček

THIS MOST LIKELY WORKS ONLY FROM SWITZERLAND, SINCE THE IPTV SERVICE
FROM TELEBOY.CH IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO SWISS IP ADDRESSES.

Requirements
------------

This script is based on the following binary programs:

     o MPlayer - The Movie Player
       Most likely mplayer is delivered by your distribution. If you need
       a bleeding edge version, go to:
       http://www.mplayerhq.hu/

     o rtmpdump - a dumping tool for rtmp streams
       http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/

     o wget

     o crontab

     o date

     o whiptail


Usage
-----

Do 'watchteleboy --help' in order to get a quick summary of the available
options. When invoked without options it starts in interactive mode.


Bugs
